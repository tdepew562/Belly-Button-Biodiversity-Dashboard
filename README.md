# üåü Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard üåü

Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard! Explore the fascinating world of microbes found in human navels with interactive charts and sample pictures.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Select a test subject ID from the dropdown menu to view their demographic information and microbial data.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dropdown Menu**: Select a test subject ID to view corresponding data.
- **Demographic Info**: View demographic information for each test subject.
- **Bar Chart**: Display the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in the selected test subject.
- **Bubble Chart**: Visualize the distribution of OTUs in a bubble chart.
- **Gauge Chart**: See the belly button washing frequency for each test subject.
